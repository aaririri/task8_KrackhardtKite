# Graph Isomorphism Testing - WL Test Experiments

This repository contains experiments exploring the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test for graph isomorphism. Building on previous analysis(task 7) of the AIDS dataset, we investigate the robustness of graph isomorphism under small perturbations (Experiment A) and validate the accuracy of WL test results (Experiment B).

## Experiment A: Noise and Robustness
Investigates how single edge modifications affect graph isomorphism relationships detected by the WL test.


## Experiment B: Validating WL Test Results
